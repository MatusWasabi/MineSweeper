# MineSweeper Game Development Showcase Overview Document

## Purpose

In order to land myself a job, I created this project to showcase my skills in developing a video game with Unity.
I chose to develop MineSweeper, MineSweeper, as it is a classic game with simple and easy-to-understand rules.

## Contents

Skills to showcase include

1. Documentation -> I primarily document the code itself to ensure clarity and ease of collaboration. While I typically prefer using tools like Jira and Confluence for broader project documentation, this project focuses on code documentation.
2. Unity UI Toolkit -> I used Unity UI Toolkit mainly for the main menu. Although itâ€™s a small part of the project, it demonstrates my ability to implement the latest UI technology in Unity
3. Design Patterns -> I applied the Visitor, State, Singleton, and Observer design patterns to solve common problems in the game development process, improving maintainability and flexibility.
4. S.O.L.I.D. principles -> I self-review my code using the S.O.L.I.D. principles to ensure high-quality software architecture and maintainability.
5. .Net & Unity C# -> MonoBehaviour is more performance-consuming compared to plain .NET C#. I coded the State pattern in plain C# to demonstrate a more performance-efficient approach before applying it in Unity C#
6. Building Game with Unity Command Line Interface -> I interested in making CI/CD and automation process. In this project, I wrote a small build script to fulfill my curiosity.

## Audience

This project is primarily aimed at programmers due to its depth in technical subjects, but it can also appeal to hiring managers looking for a developer with strong coding and design principles
